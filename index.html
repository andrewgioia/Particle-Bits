			<h2 class="serif green">CSS3 button article at Typekit</h2>
			<p>I wrote an article about creating an animated, image-free button with CSS3 and Typekit type and it's been published today over at the Typekit Blog. Thanks to Mandy Brown for coordinating and editing it.</p>
			<p>In a way, the article is an extension to a lot of the stuff I talk about in CSS3 For Web Designers: using the experience layer as a place to fully embrace the pieces of CSS3 that have decent support today amongst modern browsers. Buttons are a perfect place to experiment that way&mdash;and embedded type makes them all the better, while remaining flexible. <span class="end">&</span></p>

			<h2 class="serif purple">On Speaking</h2>
			<p>Back in 2004, Christopher Schmitt asked me to share a CSS panel at SXSW alongside Doug Bowman and Dave Shea. I was terrified. I'd never spoken in front of a large group of people before, and frankly the very idea of such a thing had always made me tremble with paralyzing fear. But when you're asked to speak with Bowman and Shea, you pack your bags and you go do it.</p>
			<p>And I survived.</p>
			<p>We did it again the following year, and I survived again. I remember thinking, "well this isn't so bad, no lives are at stake here." So I started saying yes to other events, eventually constructing hour-long talks and workshops that could be repeated in various cities around the globe. I survived those too, and hopefully I was able to entertain and share some thinking around designing websites with web standards.</p>
			<p>I'm taking a hiatus from speaking in 2011 to recharge and focus on other things, but thought I'd share some of what I've learned from speaking over the last several years, from someone who isn't a naturally-born speaker or expert in speaking, hates flying, and generally get anxious about combining those two activities.</p>
			<p>Some of the follow points might be obvious for some, but they're all important bits I try and keep in mind before every talk. I've learned most of them from other speakers, articles and advice from colleagues and event organizers. <span class="end">&</span></p>
