			<h2 class="serif blue">CSS3 button article at Typekit</h2>
			<p>I wrote an article about creating an animated, image-free button with CSS3 and Typekit type and it's been published today over at the Typekit Blog. Thanks to Mandy Brown for coordinating and editing it.</p>
			<p>In a way, the article is an extension to a lot of the stuff I talk about in CSS3 For Web Designers: using the experience layer as a place to fully embrace the pieces of CSS3 that have decent support today amongst modern browsers. Buttons are a perfect place to experiment that way&mdash;and embedded type makes them all the better, while remaining flexible. <span class="end">&</span></p>

			<h2 class="serif blue">On Speaking</h2>
			<p>Back in 2004, Christopher Schmitt asked me to share a CSS panel at SXSW alongside Doug Bowman and Dave Shea. I was terrified. I'd never spoken in front of a large group of people before, and frankly the very idea of such a thing had always made me tremble with paralyzing fear. But when you're asked to speak with Bowman and Shea, you pack your bags and you go do it.</p>
			<p>And I survived.</p>
			<p>We did it again the following year, and I survived again. I remember thinking, "well this isn't so bad, no lives are at stake here." So I started saying yes to other events, eventually constructing hour-long talks and workshops that could be repeated in various cities around the globe. I survived those too, and hopefully I was able to entertain and share some thinking around designing websites with web standards.</p>
			<p>I'm taking a hiatus from speaking in 2011 to recharge and focus on other things, but thought I'd share some of what I've learned from speaking over the last several years, from someone who isn't a naturally-born speaker or expert in speaking, hates flying, and generally get anxious about combining those two activities.</p>
			<p>Some of the follow points might be obvious for some, but they're all important bits I try and keep in mind before every talk. I've learned most of them from other speakers, articles and advice from colleagues and event organizers. <span class="end">&</span></p>

			<h2 class="serif blue">Design Is Not the Goal</h2>
			<p>There is a well-known saying by Benjamin Franklin that states, "In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes." If we take that lens to interaction design, we could say: In design nothing can be said to be certain, except eye candy and following new trends. The screens are changing, but the approach, sadly enough, is not.</p>
			<p>Designers have penchant for all things with textures, embellishments, 3-D characteristics, as well as over-emphasized and generated effects&mdash;this is where design is currently hovering. It is heavy on the visible layer of design and that is the intention. This approach is limiting because it places focus on getting attention for the design itself, rather than designing for purpose.</p>
			<p>If I had to describe Web/interface design today I would say it looks like anything that Apple does&mdash;multiplied by ten. They have certainly given us some of the best examples of experiences and proven to be very profitable with them. Steve Jobs does it right, famously saying, "Design is how it works, not how it looks," but most firms copy his aesthetics and not his philosophy, applying design merely as marketing gloss in order to capture additional sales.</p>
			<p>While they (Apple) remain a leading influencer in interaction design, they aren't always perfect. Recently, they have jumped the skeumorphic shark with the latest iteration of iCal for the Mac OS. It seems they have forgotten their own design philosophy and are only changing how it looks, rather than changing how it works. <span class="end">&</span></p>
